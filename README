How To Begin Running the program:
                         * Download the program and CSV *
1. Download the program from Github.
  - Go to https//:github.com/Bryce512/Premier_Automation
  - Click the green 'Code' button
  - Click 'Download ZIP'
  - Unzip the folder called Premier_Automation_main
2. Download the spreadsheet as a CSV by going to 
    Excel/Google Sheets > File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv)
3. Move this file into the same folder as CSVtoTXT.py in Premier_Automation
  - Rename the file to something that is only ONE word (like BYUSpring2024.csv)

                * Now we need to see if you have Python installed. *
4. Right click on CSVtoTXT, click 'Open in Terminal'
    - If that didn't work, Press 'Win' key then type 'powershell' then hit 'Enter'
5. Copy and paste "python --version", then hit 'Enter'
    - if you get something like this 'Python 3.8.4' 
      then you have it installed! skip to step 8.
    - if not, continue with step 6.
6. Type 'Python' in the terminal, hit 'Enter' 
    - It should bring you to the Microsoft store.
    - Click 'Get' > 'Install on My devices' > 'Install Now' > 'OK'
    - If the installation was successful, you’ll see the message 
        “This product is installed” at the top of the page.
7. Now double check it was installed by repeating step 5.

                         * Now that Python is installed *
8. Right Click again on CSVtoTXT in Premier_Automation_main
9. Click 'Open with...' > 'Python' 
    - it may be some other name but it will have Python in the title.

                    * You Did it! Now just follow the instructions *
                  * and your new file will appear in the same folder! *



Tips for entering data:
  - Enter the CSV into an EXCEL sheet (if not already) to get the column letters
  - Enter a single letter or range a-z
      - ex. 'a' or 'a-z'
  - The program is NOT Case Sensitive
      - ex. 'a' works just as 'A'
  - Do NOT enter with quotation marks.
  - You can not undo something once you hit 'Enter'
      - luckily it runs pretty quick so just restart


*************************** -------> TroubleShooting <------------- *****************
  - If the program gives an INDEX ERROR: 
      - You probably just typed something in
        wrong so just restart with hitting 'CTRL' then 'C'.
      - Be sure to check that you are working with the correct columns. 
          ex. the program will give an error if it tries to capitalize a phone number
