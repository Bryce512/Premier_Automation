How To Begin Running the program:





Tips for entering data:
  - Enter the CSV into an EXCEL sheet (if not already) to get the column letters
  - Enter a single letter or range a-z
      - ex. 'a' or 'a-z'
  - The program is NOT Case Sensitive
      - ex. 'a' works just as 'A'
  - Do NOT enter with quotation marks.
  - You can not undo something once you hit 'Enter'
      - luckily it runs pretty quick so just restart


*************************** -------> TroubleShooting <------------- *****************
  - If the program gives an INDEX ERROR: 
      - You probably just typed something in
        wrong so just restart with hitting 'CTRL' then 'C'.
      - Be sure to check that you are working with the correct columns. 
          ex. the program will give an error if it tries to capitalize a phone number
