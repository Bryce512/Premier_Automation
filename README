1. Cleans the entry information on CSV
  * Capitalizes all names
  * Ignores entries without an event selected
  * Allows you to chooose which entry information you want to keep
2. Exports a TXT file needed for merging databases

How To Begin Running the program:
                         * Download the program and CSV *
1. Download the program from Github.
  * Go to https//:github.com/Bryce512/Premier_Automation
  * Click the green 'Code' button
  * Click 'Download ZIP'
  * Unzip the folder called Premier_Automation_main
2. Download the spreadsheet as a CSV by going to 
    Excel/Google Sheets > File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv)
3. Move this file into the same folder as CSVtoTXT.py in Premier_Automation
  - Rename the file to something that is only ONE word (like BYUSpring2024.csv)

                * Now we need to see if you have Python installed. *
4. Right click on CSVtoTXT, click 'Open in Terminal'
    - If that didn't work, Press 'Win' key then type 'powershell' then hit 'Enter'
5. Copy and paste "python --version", then hit 'Enter'
    - if you get something like this 'Python 3.8.4' 
      then you have it installed! skip to step 8.
    - if not, continue with step 6.
6. Type 'Python' in the terminal, hit 'Enter' 
    - It should bring you to the Microsoft store.
    - Click 'Get' > 'Install on My devices' > 'Install Now' > 'OK'
    - If the installation was successful, you’ll see the message 
        “This product is installed” at the top of the page.
7. Now double check it was installed by repeating step 5.

                         * Now that Python is installed *
8. Right Click again on CSVtoTXT in Premier_Automation_main
9. Click 'Open with...' > 'Python' 
    - it may be some other name but it will have Python in the title.

                    * You Did it! Now just follow the instructions *
                  * and your new file will appear in the same folder! *

Using the Program:
1. Read the start-up instructions
2. Enter the columns that contain the first and last names of the participants
  * This first set of entries is used to capitalize the names.
  * You can include the Teacher's names as well if you'd like
3. Enter the columns you would like to skip
4. Enter the columns that contain the dance events
  * There should be 3 for Bronze, Silver, and Gold.
  * Enter as a range or individual columns.
5. At this point the program will run and tell you
  * "File Done! Your TXT file is called {name of file} *
  * Look for this file in the same folder as the program.

Tips for entering data:
1. Enter the CSV into an EXCEL sheet (if not already) to get the column letters
2. Enter a single letter or range
  * ex. 'a' or 'a-z'
3. The program is NOT Case Sensitive
  * ex. 'a' works just as 'A'
4. Do NOT enter with quotation marks.
5. You can not undo something once you hit 'Enter'
  * luckily it runs pretty quick so just restart with 'CTRL' > 'c'
6. You have to hit 'Enter' when you're done with the prompt in order to move to the next one.
  * Just don't type anything and hit 'Enter' to move on.


*************************** -------> TroubleShooting <------------- *****************
  - If the program gives an INDEX ERROR: 
      - You probably just typed something in
        wrong so just restart with hitting 'CTRL' then 'c'.
      - Be sure to check that you are working with the correct columns. 
          ex. the program will give an error if it tries to capitalize a phone number
